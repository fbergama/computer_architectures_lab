# Debugging an assembly program

1) start gdb:

$ gdb <executable file>

2) configure the layout
At the gdb prompt (gdb), give the following commands:

(gdb) layout asm
(gdb) layout reg
(gdb) focus cmd

The terminal window is divided in 3 parts. At the top you have the CPU
registers, at the center the program disassebly and at the bottom the gdb
console.
To use c-x o (Ctrl+x o) to cycle focus between each window.

3) Run the program and stop at the first instruction (_start entrypoint)

(gdb) starti


4) debug the program.

List of useful commands:

### List all symbols
(gdb) info variables


### Execute single machine code instruction
(gdb) si 


### Print register content with a specified format:
(gdb) p/<fmt> $<reg>

    where <fmt> can be:
    x  for hex
    u  for unsigned int
    d  for signed int
    c  for char
    s  for string
    t  for binary

    and <reg> can be any register: x0...x30, w0...w30, or pc

    Examples:

    Print the program counter in hex
    p/x $pc
    Print the register w3 as binary number
    p/t $w3


### Dump memory content
(gdb) x/<n>xb <addr>

    where <n> is the number of bytes
    <addr> is a memory address, or the address of a variable &<var>


5) quit the debugger
(gdb) quit




# Debugging a C program

1) start gdb:

$ gdb <executable file>

2) configure the layout
At the gdb prompt (gdb), give the following command:

(gdb) layout split

3) add a breakpoint to the main() function

(gdb) b main

4) run the program

(gdb) run
